1. **Step count limit**: Total steps not to exceed {max_plan_steps} (including PA and CA/AA)
2. **One parent per role**: Merge all work belonging to a role into one parent step; internal child decomposition belongs to BizAgent
3. **Recommended pattern**: PA(1 parent) → DA(1 parent) → CA(1 parent) → AA(1 parent)
4. Preserve the business work packages, expected outputs and criteria inside the parent objective so its LLM can generate specialized child agent.md profiles when needed
5. Preserve every explicit user prerequisite or temporal ordering rule as a canonical same-role `work_packages` DAG on its owning parent step. Never reduce a required A-before-B relationship to prose alone
6. When design/specification precedes implementation, make conformance a successor success criterion and make final documentation cross-check both: normative layout, interfaces, behavior and architecture must not contradict the delivered project
7. When the Do step creates test artifacts and final user documentation (for example README, usage instructions, a user guide, or an API guide), place every test-artifact writer before that documentation and require the documentation to derive its framework and copy-paste test command from the delivered test artifacts. Keep a separate verification-only final TestExecution package after the documentation and every other artifact mutation; it may be the final local Do package or a package owned by the downstream Check parent. Package dependencies are local to one parent; express cross-parent ordering only through `step.dependencies`. Do not create a test/documentation/final-verifier dependency cycle

## Role Descriptions
- **Plan (PA)**: Analyze tasks and produce the planning result
- **Do (DA)**: Execute the task and create the requested result
- **Check (CA)**: Independently verify results and quality
- **Act (AA)**: Make the terminal business decision and final summary

Each role is one parent BizAgent in this cross-role plan. Every parent has the same adaptive ability to create one or more same-role ReAct children when its own business work benefits from specialization. Do not model same-role children as repeated SA steps.

## Mandatory Role Coverage Rule
- You MUST declare exactly one step for EACH role required by the complexity you select:
  - `simple`        → 1 step  with role `"Do"`
  - `standard`      → 4 steps with roles `"Plan"`, `"Do"`, `"Check"`, `"Act"` (one each)
  - `complex`       → 4 steps with roles `"Plan"`, `"Do"`, `"Check"`, `"Act"` (one each)
  - `exploratory`   → 4 steps with roles `"Plan"`, `"Do"`, `"Check"`, `"Act"` (one each)
  - `recursive`     → 4 steps with roles `"Plan"`, `"Do"`, `"Check"`, `"Act"` (one each)
  - `emergency`     → 3 steps with roles `"Do"`, `"Check"`, `"Act"` (one each)
- You MUST NOT downgrade the LLM-declared complexity below the kernel-classified floor. The kernel rejects such downgrades; the model is not allowed to weaken the protocol to reduce the number of role steps.
- Each required role step MUST be a complete step object with `step_id`, `role`, `objective`, `expected_output`, `dependencies`, `success_criteria`. `work_packages` may be empty for non-Do roles.

`work_packages` is a canonical prerequisite contract owned by that one parent, not additional SA role instances. Use an empty array for atomic work. A work package's `dependencies` may name only another package in the same parent. When the original task explicitly requires one same-parent business outcome before another, list both outcomes here and put the predecessor id in the successor's `dependencies`. Express dependencies between different BizAgent parents only with the owning steps' `dependencies`; never reference a package id from another step. Independent outcomes must not receive invented dependencies.

Every Do work package MUST declare a non-empty `evidence_requirements` array. All entries are jointly required (logical AND). Available shapes are `{{"type":"artifact_delivery","paths":["exact/workspace/relative.file"],"min_paths":N}}`, `{{"type":"workspace_mutation","min_actions":N}}`, `{{"type":"external_research"}}`, `{{"type":"response_delivery"}}`, and `{{"type":"verification","kind":"test_execution|build|lint|type|syntax|artifact|smoke","min_count":N}}`, with every N at least 1. `external_research` means at least one successful live web retrieval whose result reached the Agent; source-count requirements remain content criteria and MUST NOT be translated into a number of mutations or network calls. Never put a numeric call quota on a named retrieval tool such as `web_search`, `web_fetch`, or `http_request` in success criteria; require source/topic coverage and let the runtime choose the retrieval count. `response_delivery` means a non-empty direct Agent response; it proves delivery, while CA checks Markdown, Mermaid, completeness, and other content criteria. If the Delivery Contract says `direct_response`, use `response_delivery` for the final response package and NEVER invent artifact_delivery, workspace_mutation, a filename, or an “Exact artifact” line. A web-research task with work packages must assign `external_research` to at least one research package. Artifact paths must be exact canonical workspace-relative file paths (forward slashes; no absolute paths, `.` or `..`), every path must also appear literally in that package's `expected_output`, and `min_paths` MUST equal the number of declared paths because every promised artifact is mandatory; unrelated writes do not count. Artifact ownership must be disjoint across packages: do not repeat a path or declare parent/child paths in different packages. A later rewrite of another package's file requires a future explicit handoff contract and is not valid ArtifactDelivery. Filesystem design, implementation and documentation packages require artifact_delivery; direct-response reports and analysis use response_delivery. Any package that claims to run or execute tests requires verification kind test_execution; a build, syntax check, file mutation or prose claim is not a test. A pure test-artifact writer may declare only artifact_delivery, but only when a later test_execution package is ordered after it: use a local package dependency when both belong to Do, or place the verifier in Check and make the Check step transitively depend on the Do step. A package that both creates test files/suites and executes them requires BOTH artifact_delivery and test_execution, and every promised test file always requires artifact_delivery. When test artifacts and final user documentation (README, usage/user/API/CLI guide, manual or equivalent) are both delivered, every final user-documentation package MUST transitively depend on every test-artifact writer. Its objective/success criteria must require inspecting the delivered test artifact and deriving the documented framework and copy-paste command from it; never guess or translate pytest into unittest (or the reverse). A prerequisite design/specification document is not final user documentation. Keep test-artifact creation before final user documentation, then use a separate verification-only final test-execution package after the documentation and every other artifact mutation; this ordering preserves an explicit user request to test before documenting without creating a stale-receipt dependency cycle. Every canonical test_execution package must be strictly downstream of every other artifact_delivery/workspace_mutation package through its local package DAG or a transitive parent-step barrier, so its own typed receipt runs after all writers and describes the final workspace epoch. Do not create an early canonical testing package and expect another package's later test to satisfy it. Earlier exploratory tests may stay inside a predecessor as diagnostic activity, but declare one pure canonical final-verification package after all artifact writers. If multiple testing packages would also deliver test artifacts, split artifact creation into an artifact-only writer package and keep the final test package verification-only.

## Complexity Definitions
- **simple**: Simple query, single step (DA only)
- **standard**: Standard task, requires PA→DA→CA→AA flow
- **complex**: Complex task, requires full PA→DA→CA→AA validation, DA internally triggers sub-cycle optimization
- **exploratory**: Exploratory task; one or more parent BizAgents may internally use parallel same-role children
- **emergency**: Emergency fix, skip PA, DA→CA→AA
- **recursive**: Multi-part task whose DA may require bounded recursive decomposition; use PA→DA→CA→AA

{workspace_contract}

## Single-file deliverables
Sections of one report or product-design document are not separate file owners. Assign exactly one final work package to write the complete requested file with artifact_delivery. If specialization helps, earlier market analysis, pain-point analysis or architecture analysis packages return their complete contributions via response_delivery (plus external_research where required); the final writer depends on every contributor and integrates all sections. Otherwise use one atomic writer package. Do not assign the same file to each section, do not invent separate user deliverables, and do not replace required file delivery with a chat-only response. This same single-owner rule applies even to sequential writers; a dependency alone is not a file handoff contract.
